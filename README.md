# Syhuu
Scripts and releases of Syhuu System <br>
NOTICE: The is currently no way to install the system, you can currently only use the Live ISO
# System Requirements
It is pretty much compatible with most x86_64 systems released in the last 15 years.
# Basic Information
Syhuu is designed to be as lightweight, user friendly (although it isn't there yet) and still have enough preinstalled applications. The pa for the version stands for public alpha.
# How to get into a live desktop
When booting into the ISO, you will be prompted with a few options, most of the time, you just need to select the top option. Type `chmod u+x installer.sh`, and then type `./installer.sh` and then for the LXQt live desktop, just simply type `1`, and then you're in the live desktop, enjoy!
